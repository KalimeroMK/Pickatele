<br>The Pickatale story
Pickatale story started back in 2013. Knowing that children today grow up with digital devices, it's natural for parents and teachers to use apps for educational purposes. There are so many mobile apps intended for children, but we realized there's one important problem. These apps are addictive and without any real educational value to improve children's reading and language learning skills.

We wanted to help children develop a love of reading. In the course of the years, Pickatale now features 1000+ interactive childrenÂ’s books in our app on English, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish and Chinese. We are paying special attention to each and every book released and we take pride in the knowing that both, the parents and children will enjoy the experience.

Always on the lookout for talented individuals, we bring together the work of authors, illustrators, narrators and translators from all over the globe, sewing them seamlessly together into unique pieces of our own and delivering them to children all around the world through the library apps. Our books are to a child what art galleries are to an adult: a collection of masterpieces, finely curated by our dedicated team of professionals.

CMS is built with Laravel PHP Framework and Bootstrap 3.3.6
