                            <p>
                                We may share the information we collect, including your personal information, as follows:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We may use your public information to promote the Service and to help others find and follow you and/or your Pickatale profile content, including through Facebook and Other Integrated Services.
                                Your information may also be used to notify others, including on the Service, via e-mail through Facebook and Other Integrated Services, that you have joined Pickatale, and about activity related to their Pickatale profiles, content which they follow, or which we think otherwise may be of interest to them. Likewise, we may notify you about such activity of others.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            <p>
                                If you connect to Pickatale using Facebook or otherwise connect your Pickatale account to an Other Integrated Service, the default setting is generally that Pickatale automatically shares your activity and activity-related stories with that service, including the books you read. You understand that such information may be attributed to your account on Facebook or the Other Integrated Service and may be published on such service
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pickatale also enables you to share a particular item of content, on an individual basis, to third party services or other Pickatale users by using the share functionality in the Service. Please note that sharing of such content on a third party service may be posted as activity on the Service, regardless of your account settings. To share an individual item of content to a third party service, you'll be prompted to enter your access credentials for that third party service. Pickatale may store your username and an access token or similar credentials obtained from the third party service, so that you are able to share particular items of content, on that third party service, on an individual basis, without entering your access credentials again.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                To personalise your experience, we may share some information we have collected about you with providers of Third Party Applications, such as high-level geographic information, your book taste preferences, settings and technical data. However, we take precautions to prohibit Third Party Application providers from attempting to identify you by using the information we provide to them or by collecting additional information without your consent.

                            <p>
                                Pickatale processes information about our users on servers located in a number of countries. Accordingly, Pickatale may share your information with other companies in the Pickatale Group for the purpose of them carrying out any of the activities specified in this Privacy Policy. Pickatale may also subcontract processing to or share your information with third parties located in countries, other than your home country. Information collected within the European Economic Area ("EEA") and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to, and processed by companies in the Pickatale Group or other third parties identified above, located in a country outside of the EEA and Switzerland, where you may have fewer legal rights in relation to your information. However, the Pickatale Group will only process your information as described in this Privacy Policy in every country. You expressly consent to your information being used as set out in this section 6.
